# Weight-converter
Let's create a weight converter project that converts pounds to kilograms. The webpage features an input field where users can enter a weight in pounds, and the webpage automatically displays the equivalent weight in kilograms. After 10 seconds, the result is removed, and the input field is emptied using the 'set time out' method.
